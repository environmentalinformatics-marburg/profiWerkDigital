  reasons for this. The fact that linguistics is usually not taught at school is the first reason. Literary or cultural studies have a more
  privileged status in this respect. Teachers teach these subjects in school. The fact that students have to learn many new terms in
  linguistics is the second reason. It is very demanding to get a grip on all the new concepts. The abstract nature of linguistics is another
  reason. Often students are scared off by this. To include aspects of linguistics into English language teaching at school would be a
  promising way of addressing these three problem areas.</p></div>

        <p>Re-write the text so that the distances between a backgrounded passage in one colour and a word or phrase in the same color becomes smaller. You could re-write the first two sentences like example</p>

        <p>As you can see, you have reduced the distance of the two yellow bits from 13 words to zero words!!!</p>
