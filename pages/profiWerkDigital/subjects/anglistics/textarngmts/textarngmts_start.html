          <p>Texts usually follow a principle that has been called 'given-before-new', i.e. in general, a sentence starts with an element that you have already heard before, that is given, and then you add new information about that element. A very typical example can be found in simple stories, e.g. fairy tales.
For example:</p>
<p class="sent">Once upon a time there was a king. He had a beautiful daughter. She used to play in the garden. In the garden was a well. <br>In that well
lived a frog, who, in fact, was an enchanted prince and could only be rescued if he was kissed by a beautiful maiden ...</p>
<p>This way of presenting information makes it very easy for the reader to read and process the text. With each new sentence, the reader knows immediately how this
sentence relates to what has been said before. In a way, we can say that the reader knows where to 'put' the new information in the textual world. Just imagine the text
above looked like this:</p>
<p class="sent">Once upon a time there was a king. He had a beautiful daughter. She used to play in the garden. In the garden was a well. <i>A frog, who,<br>
in fact, was an enchanted prince and could only be rescued if he was kissed by a beautiful maiden lived in <font color="#FF0000">that well </font> ...</i></p>
<p>The last sentence (in italics) introduces something new into the textual world but you do not really know what to do with it, you do not know where it belongs. You have to
read the whole sentence to find out that the frog lives in the well, which was mentioned before. Not knowing what to do with information, not knowing where to put it, is
hard work for your brain. We can say that in the second example you have to keep 25 words active in your working memory until you know what to do with them. The first
version tells you almost immediately how the frog relates to what you have read before. So, it is better if each sentence begins with something that links up to the previous
text.</p>
