Already over 100 years ago, linguists formulated the idea that each sentence should begin with something that is known to the reader and then move on to something that
is new. This has been termed the given-before-new principle. If you look at the original text, you see that many sentences start with new information and that given or
known information occurs at the end. In your revised version, you have moved those known bits (closer) to the beginning of the sentence. In the new version, the
sentences all follow the given-before-new principle.</p>

    <div id="tc-content-4" >        <p class="infs">These are possible sentence structures that
you could use. For instance, sometimes you
might want to use a passive clause instead of
an active one, but maybe you might want to
change a passive to an active clause!</p>
