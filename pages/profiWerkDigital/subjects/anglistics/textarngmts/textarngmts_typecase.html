	<p>Sortiere den Text: <br>That linguistics is a difficult subject for most first-year students becomes apparent
fairly early in their first semester. There are three reasons for this. The fact that
linguistics is usually not taught at school is the first reason. Literary or cultural
studies have a more privileged status in this respect. Teachers teach these subjects
in school. The fact that students have to learn many new terms in linguistics is the
second reason. It is very demanding to get a grip on all the new concepts. The
abstract nature of linguistics is another reason. Often students are scared off by
this. </p><!--<spam id="index">Index </spam> -->
